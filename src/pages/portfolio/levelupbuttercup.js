    <p>LEVEL UP BUTTERCUP
    This is a brand I created for an all girls D&D group that I had with my friends. We streamed on Twitch and sold t-shirts. The script is a custom font I created for the brand. I also created all of the custom illustrations and animations.
     
    The feeling is a combination of classic D&D with 90s computer games with a touch of feminine flare.
