        INITIAL WEB DESIGNS FOR FILLAUER
This client had pre-existing brand. They asked us to extend their brand, and design an engaging website experience. We diagnosed their users, created user flows and consolidated their existing products.
I designed the site to use fluid typography and buttons that re-size with the same proportions.
USER PERSONAS
I worked with a team to create user personas to better inform user flows and organize content throughout the site.
DESIGN EXPLORATION
I designed mood-boards or style tiles with UI elements to help the client envision how their existing brand would look as a website.
WHITEBOARD SESSIONS
I sketched wireframes during live white-boarding sessions with our team. Which addressed the needs and concerns for each user persona on key pages throughout the site
