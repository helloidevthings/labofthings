        HEARTMENDERS
This is a childrenâ€™s book that I had the opportunity to illustrate and design while working at Robin Easter. It was a beautiful experience.
 
The illustrations are made using a Wacom tablet and Photoshop. I started by sketching each of these out by hand and then taking those sketches into Photoshop.
 
I attended the SCBWI (Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators) conference in NYC as a part of my research for this project.
